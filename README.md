# leaflet-challenge
Purpose: to create the Earthquake Visualization <br>
1. Select any dataset from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php <br>
  - ex: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/significant_month.geojson
2. Import and visualize the data using leaflet <br>
  - data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. <br>
  - include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked. <br>
  - create a legend that will provide context for your map data. <br>
